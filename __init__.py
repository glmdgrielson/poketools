"""Pokétools, with an accented E.
These are not tools for sticking fingers into things. These are also not
tools for the Pokémon *video* games either. These are for
Pokémon Tabletop United, which as you can probably guess, is a tabletop
RPG. These tools will primarily be of assistance to people running
the game, since it makes dealing with the frankly mind-boggling amount
of data one has to work with, slightly less taxing.
