Pokétools
=========

Once, there was a user named ElementalKnight. They made a useful collection
of tools, and shared them with the world. How nice of them.

Then, there was a second user, who picked a Scrabble hand for a username.
They wanted to use these tools for their game. Unfortunately, these tools were
made in _Excel_, which rendered them basically useless for the poor Linux user.

Thus, this project: a port of ElementalKnight's PTU Pokémon Generator in the
slightly more portable format of Python scripts.

Data for this project is partially stolen from [ptu-toolkit](https://github.com/fedorablewill/ptu-toolkit) and rewritten for my own preferences.
